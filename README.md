# DataAnalyticsCourseWork

This paper consists of a review into data analytics methods and practices applied to drought data from counties in the United States of America. The aim of the paper is to review two data analytics methods; Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) and analyse their effectiveness in predicting drought scores for a given US county provided with past meteorological data from a particular location. ARIMA was found to have poor long term predictive capabilities of drought score, however, can be applied effectively to estimate more seasonal univariate timeseries in the dataset such as precipitation. It was found that LSTM provided a good estimation of drought score for county Autauga (FIPS code 1001). However further testing and expansion of this model should be carried out in order to incorporate training and predictive capabilities for other counties. Additional analysis of the dataset and increased domain expertise  would be required to increase the modelâ€™s accuracy. It is concluded that for the production of a true model, soil data should also be included in any modelling going forward to enable produced models to scale for use in larger real world applications.
